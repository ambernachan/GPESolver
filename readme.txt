The Matlab toolbox "GPELab" was created by prof. Romain Duboscq and prof. Xavier Antoine;
it was presented in the following papers:
X. Antoine and R. Duboscq, GPELab, a Matlab Toolbox to Solve Gross-Pitaevskii Equations I: Computation of Stationary Solutions, Computer Physics Communications 185 (11), (2014), pp. 2969-2991.
X. Antoine and R. Duboscq, GPELab, a Matlab Toolbox to Solve Gross-Pitaevskii Equations II: Dynamics and Stochastic Simulations, Computer Physics Communications 193, (2015), pp. 95-117.

This repository contains the Matlab toolbox GPELab in the folder "GPELabToolbox", with minor edits by Amber de Bruijn
It also contains some additional simulation files and utils scripts by Amber de Bruijn but as of July '21 there is not yet a 'cleaned up' version, it will follow later.
